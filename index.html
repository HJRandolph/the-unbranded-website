          <p>Enamored at a young age with storytelling, Sarah tortured her family and friends throughout the 90s with re-worked 
            revivals of classics like <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>Annie</em> (in which she gracefully accepted the title role). 
            Sarah eventually moved to New York, attended NYU Tisch to study acting, threw out all of her clothing that wasn’t black, 
            and developed a taste for bodega breakfast sandwiches. Sarah writes plays that range from thriller to 80s musical parody 
            and is eager to help others tell their stories.</p>

            for logic and tech activities flowed though all aspects of life, school and work until she could no longer deny the

            honed that intuition through a wide variety of jobs – working in everything from retail and fine dining to musical 
            comedy and film production, with pit stops along the way to pick up some dog training skills and an undergrad degree 
            from NYU. Her non-traditional path (though stressful for her parents) has taught her that following her gut when it 
            comes to ethical values is essential and that this principle too often gets lost within workplaces. While pivoting 
            to coding and design in the chaos of 2020, the idea for The Unbranded presented itself as an opportunity to 
            constructively exercise her management skills, and more importantly put her values into practice. She is incredibly 
            grateful and excited to get to do both with such a remarkable team beside her.</p>
